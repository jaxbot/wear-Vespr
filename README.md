# WiFi hotspot aware Vespr card notification

When WiFi is enabled on Android, the system provides broadcasts about the WiFi SSIDs it finds. Since it is continually doing this anyway, I decided to hook into it and a use it to show a notification on my Android Wear watch with my Vespr Frequent Flyer QR code.

It was a fun project to solve the simple but real problem of having to remove my card from my wallet.

Open source, MIT, and a little bit hacky. Enjoy!
